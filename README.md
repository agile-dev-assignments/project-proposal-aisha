# Project Proposal

##Project Title - The Tourist

##What and Why?
I want to build an app that gives tourists recommendation on where to eat, what to visit, where the best views of the city are based on other travelers and locals advice. Travelling to a new place can be daunting and having recommendations and suggestions from people who have been there can ease some of that stress. I want it to have a format similar to reddit, so threads based on location and then an index for food, entertainment, arts etc recommendation. People can drop suggestions and upvote/downvote the ones they like or dislike. 

##For whom?
The Tourist is for anyone who enjoys travelling and is looking for new and exciting experiences and people who love talking about their experiences.

#How?
A user would type in the city of interest and an index will appear with different categories: food, entertainment, arts, adventure, general, etc. They can click on the catgeory they are interested in and make a post or view other people's posts. 

#Scope
Since it is entirely contributed to by users, we'd have to find people to write a few posts. I think for this app to succeed it needs a great UI in terms of the aesthetics but it also needs to be easily navigated. The indexing should make that easier. Implementing this app in iOS and Android as well as a UI should be enough work for 4-6 programmers
